# Wise monitor app

We are building a chrome extension and a small websocket server to monitor events created by webhooks on Wise.com

## Setup

### Step 1

Use Ngrok for development: https://ngrok.com/

In the command line create a tunnel to expose localhost:

```
ngrok http 5000
```

### Step 2

Load the chrome extension

### Step 3

Create the webhook in your Wise.com account

### Step 4

Launch the websocket server locally

## Todo

[ ] monitor events from webhooks
[ ] setup communication between background.js and popup.js
